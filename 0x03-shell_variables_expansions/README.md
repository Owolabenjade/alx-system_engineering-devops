Task 0 is a script that creates an alias called ls that executes the rm * command, which deletes all the files in the current directory.
Task 1 is a script that will use the echo command to print a greeting message to the standard output, which is usually the terminal. The $USER variable will be replaced by the name of the current Linux user, which is stored in the environment.
