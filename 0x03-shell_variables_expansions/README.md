Task 0 is a script that creates an alias called ls that executes the rm * command, which deletes all the files in the current directory.
Task 1 is a script that will use the echo command to print a greeting message to the standard output, which is usually the terminal. The $USER variable will be replaced by the name of the current Linux user, which is stored in the environment.
Task 2 is a script that will append /action to the end of the existing PATH variable, separated by a colon (:). The export command will make the new PATH value available to all processes in the current shell session
Task 3 is a script that will use the tr command to replace the colon (:) characters in the PATH variable with newline (\n) characters, effectively splitting the PATH into separate lines for each directory. The <<< operator is a bash feature that allows you to use a string as the standard input for a command.
