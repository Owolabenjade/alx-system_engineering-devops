Outage Postmortem

Issue Summary
Duration of the Outage:
- Start Time: 2024-06-10 14:00 UTC
- End Time: 2024-06-10 15:30 UTC

Impact:
- The web application was down for 1.5 hours.
- Users experienced a 500 Internal Server Error when trying to access the main service.
- Approximately 75% of users were affected, as the service was completely unavailable during the outage.

Root Cause:
- A misconfigured database connection string after a routine maintenance update caused the web application to fail to connect to the database.

Timeline
- 14:00 - Issue detected via automated monitoring alert indicating increased error rates.
- 14:05 - Alert confirmed by on-call engineer.
- 14:10 - Initial investigation began, focusing on recent code deployments.
- 14:20 - Engineers assumed the issue was related to the new feature deployed earlier that day.
- 14:30 - Misleading debugging path led engineers to roll back the latest deployment, but the issue persisted.
- 14:45 - Incident escalated to the Database Administration (DBA) team after initial debugging attempts failed.
- 15:00 - DBA team identified that the database connection string in the configuration file was incorrect.
- 15:10 - Correct database connection string was applied, and the configuration file was updated.
- 15:20 - Web application restarted, and normal service was restored.
- 15:30 - Monitoring confirmed that error rates returned to normal, and all systems were operational.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
- The issue was caused by an incorrect database connection string in the configuration file. During a routine maintenance update, the connection string was inadvertently modified, resulting in the web application being unable to establish a connection to the database. This misconfiguration led to the application failing and returning 500 Internal Server Errors.

Resolution:
- The DBA team identified the incorrect database connection string in the configuration file. The correct connection string was obtained and updated in the configuration file. After applying the correct settings, the web application was restarted, restoring normal functionality.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements and Fixes:
- Improve configuration management processes to prevent incorrect settings from being applied.
- Implement automated validation checks for configuration changes before deployment.
- Enhance monitoring to detect and alert on database connection issues more quickly.

Task List:
Patch Configuration Management System: Review and update the configuration management system to include automated validation checks for critical configuration changes.
Implement Configuration Validation Scripts: Develop scripts to validate the database connection string and other critical configurations before applying changes.
Enhance Monitoring: Add specific monitoring for database connection health and alerting mechanisms to detect and notify about connection issues immediately.
Conduct Training: Provide training sessions for engineers on the importance of configuration management and the use of validation tools.
Review and Update Documentation: Update the documentation to include procedures for validating configuration changes and handling similar outages in the future.

By implementing these measures, we aim to prevent similar incidents from occurring and improve the overall reliability of our web application.
