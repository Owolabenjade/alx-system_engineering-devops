# Outage Postmortem

## Issue Summary
**Duration of the Outage:**
- Start Time: 2024-06-10 14:00 UTC
- End Time: 2024-06-10 15:30 UTC

**Impact:**
- The Travel Buddy Match application was completely unavailable for 1.5 hours
- Users attempting to access the service encountered a blank screen with a "Cannot connect to server" error
- Approximately 85% of users were affected, as only cached content remained partially accessible
- New user registrations, trip creation, and all matching functionality were completely non-functional

**Root Cause:**
- A Firebase Authentication configuration change deployed during a routine update caused the application to lose connection to the authentication service, preventing all authenticated API calls

## Timeline
- **14:00** - Multiple users reported login failures through support channels
- **14:05** - Automated monitoring detected a significant drop in successful API calls
- **14:10** - On-call engineer acknowledged the alert and began initial investigation
- **14:15** - Issue confirmed to be affecting production environment only, development environment remained functional
- **14:20** - Initial investigation focused on recent frontend deployment that occurred at 13:45 UTC
- **14:30** - Frontend rollback attempted but failed to resolve the authentication issues
- **14:40** - Investigation shifted to backend Firebase services after logs showed authentication rejection patterns
- **14:50** - Incident escalated to senior developer and Firebase specialist
- **15:00** - Root cause identified: a Firebase project configuration change had invalidated the API keys used by the application
- **15:10** - Emergency fix implemented by restoring previous Firebase configuration settings
- **15:20** - Services gradually restored as configuration propagated
- **15:30** - Full service functionality confirmed, monitoring showed normal operation

## Root Cause and Resolution
**Root Cause:**
The outage was caused by an unintentional change to the Firebase Authentication configuration during a planned security update. A developer had modified the API access restrictions in the Firebase Console, limiting API requests to specific domains for enhanced security. However, the production domain was incorrectly entered (`travbuddymatch.com` instead of `travelbuddymatch.com`), causing all authentication requests from the actual production domain to be rejected.

**Resolution:**
The immediate fix involved correcting the domain allowlist in the Firebase Console security settings to include the correct production domain. Additionally, the team updated the API access controls to include both development and staging environments to prevent similar issues in the future.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
**Improvements to be made:**
1. Implement more robust authentication fallback mechanisms to gracefully handle authentication service failures
2. Enhance monitoring specifically for authentication service status
3. Create a formalized process for Firebase configuration changes with proper validation steps
4. Improve user-facing error messages to provide clearer information during service disruptions

**Specific tasks to address the issue:**
1. Create a configuration validation script that verifies all Firebase settings before and after any changes
2. Implement a dual-approval process for all production environment configuration changes
3. Add automated tests to verify authentication flow functionality after deployments
4. Update the incident response playbook with specific steps for authentication failure scenarios
5. Deploy an improved client-side caching mechanism to allow basic app functionality during authentication outages
6. Add redundant error reporting systems that don't rely on the primary authentication service
7. Schedule a team training session on Firebase security best practices and configuration management

This incident highlighted the critical dependency on third-party authentication services and the need for better change management processes. The team is committed to implementing these improvements to prevent similar outages in the future and minimize impact on users when technical issues do occur.
